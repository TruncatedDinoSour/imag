# imag

> simple and hackable suckless image board

the imag image board is made to be simple, though separated, so you
could easily add or remove features, update them, etc

this is not sole software, it is suckless ( ? ) software, which you are meant
to hack yourself,, you can, of course, use the default settings and whatnot,
but it is highly encouraged to make forks and hack it yourself :)
